# LING 619: Practical Exercises in Data Science for Linguistic Research (Spring 2019)


## Basics
* **Instructor:** Bradley McDonnell (mcdonn@hawaii.edu)
* **Dates ~ times:** TBD (Meetings twice a month for 1 hour)
* **Location:** Phonetics Lab (Moore 162) 

## Course description
This course is designed to equip students working with a broad range of linguistic data to use cutting edge research methodologies in data science. It will be held in conjunction with the [Data Science Group](https://github.com/uhm-dsg) at the [University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/), which is currently run by the [Department of Linguistics](http://ling.hawaii.edu/). Students enrolled in the course will be expected to participate in the Data Science Group meetings below.  

## Course schedule
Below is a tentative course schedule. 

|   | **Date** | **Topic**                                   |

| 3 | TBD      | Linking git & GitHub                        |
| 4 | TBD      | Collaborating on GitHub                     |
| 5 | TBD      | Data visualization with ggplot (part 1)     |
| 6 | TBD      | Data visualization with ggplot (part 1)     |
| 7 | TBD      | Data transformation with tidyverse (part 1) |
| 8 | TBD      | Data transformation with tidyverse (part 2) |

## Resources
This course will draw on two valuable resources: 

1. [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham
2. Lessons from [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)

## Course requirements
Students are required to participate in the 8 meetings listed above and will be asked to be a facilitator for at least one of these meetings. In addition, students are required to *either* participate in 4 LAE lab workshops throughout the semester *or* demonstrate equivilent  progress on a project that relates to this course.

### Final project
Students in the course will be required to create a GitHub repository that contains: 

1. **README.md** file that explains the content of the repository 
1. **RStudio** project with... 
    * **Dataset** (saved as a .csv file)
    * **Code** that transforms the data with tidyverse
    * **Plots** that display the data in a meaningfull way with ggplot.
